# Welcome to BiglyBT!
BiglyBT is a highly configurable and powerful torrent client and has been actively developed since 2003. It has many options and features for you to discover, but for the new user some guidance may be of help.

### Downloading

To download you need a torrent file, or a 'magnet link' (a link to the torrent file). The torrent file contains details of the download (which files it contains etc.) and instructions on how to find other peers to download from. If you already have a torrent file or magnet link then use the 'Open Torrents' button to add it to BiglyBT. If not then you can search using the 'Find Torrents' box at the top of BiglyBT, or by using your web browser etc. 

### Seeding

Bittorrent is a 'peer-to-peer' protocol, you download from other torrent users and as part of the process you upload back to them and others. If nobody uploaded then you wouldn't be able to download - part of being a responsible part of the sharing community is therefore to 'give back' as much as possible. Once you complete a download you should keep it running, or 'seeding', for as long as you can in order to do so.

### Library

Your 'Library' sits in the sidebar under the 'My Torrents' heading and contains all of your current downloads - here you can see what is downloading/seeding and access completed content. The default view shows everything in a single list, you can separate the downloading and seeding torrents via the Simple/Advanced list buttons in the toolbar. 

When you select a download more information about it is available from the tabs at the bottom of the window.
