# Welcome to BiglyBT!
BiglyBT is a highly configurable and powerful torrent client and has been actively developed since 2003. It has many options and features for you to discover, but for the new user some guidance may be of help.

### Downloading

To download you need a torrent file, or a 'magnet link' (a link to the torrent file). The torrent file contains details of the download (which files it contains etc.) and instructions on how to find other peers to download from. If you already have a torrent file or magnet link then use the 'Open Torrents' button to add it to BiglyBT. If not then you can search using the 'Find Torrents' box at the top of BiglyBT, or by using your web browser etc. 

### Seeding

Bittorrent is a 'peer-to-peer' protocol, you download from other torrent users and as part of the process you upload back to them and others. If nobody uploaded then you wouldn't be able to download - part of being a responsible part of the sharing community is therefore to 'give back' as much as possible. Once you complete a download you should keep it running, or 'seeding', for as long as you can in order to do so.

### Online Help
There is various community provided help available via the Community menu - navigate to the 'Public' section under 'Community Chat' to ask other users for advice. Please note that this isn't moderated, BiglyBT has no control over, or responsibility for, any information you may find there.
